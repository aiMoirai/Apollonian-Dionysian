                <h4 class="doc-title" id="1"><b>1. The Topic of the Exhibition: Apollonian and Dionysian</b></h4>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The choice of the theme of this exhibition is situated within the broader framework of the
                    dichotomies that permeate human experience and that have long been used to give form and meaning to
                    the complexity of existence. The concepts of the Apollonian and the Dionysian refer to a primordial
                    principle, comparable to the ancient opposition between chaos and cosmos, through which past
                    cultures sought to explain the origin and order of the universe.<br>
                    These two forces do not represent a moral opposition between good and evil, but rather a dynamic
                    tension between complementary poles: irrational and rational, instinct and measure, disorder and
                    harmony, intoxication and control. They describe different, yet equally necessary, ways through
                    which human beings perceive, interpret, and create the world. It is no coincidence that in Greek
                    religion, at the roots of Western spirituality and imagination, two deities came to embody these
                    fundamental principles, which govern life and sustain its balance.<br>
                    Apollo represents the principle of form, clarity, and measure. As the god of light, music, poetry,
                    and prophecy, he embodies the ideal of a harmonious and rational order founded on proportion and
                    knowledge. The Apollonian is the realm of luminous appearance, composed beauty, and the intellect
                    that seeks to impose structure on reality. It is the force inclined toward control, definition, and
                    stability, finding expression in artistic forms grounded in balance, symmetry, and formal
                    clarity.<br>
                    Dionysus, by contrast, embodies vital energy in its most instinctive and overwhelming form. As the
                    god of wine, intoxication, theatre, and metamorphosis, he represents the dissolution of individual
                    boundaries, the abandonment to sensory experience, and the fusion with the primordial rhythm of
                    nature. The Dionysian is excess, impulse, and dismeasure; it is the force that breaks apparent order
                    to reveal a deeper truth rooted in emotion, corporeality, and collective participation. Through
                    Dionysus, life manifests itself as continuous flow and incessant transformation.<br>
                    It was the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who systematically articulated this opposition,
                    identifying the Apollonian and the Dionysian as the two original forces of art and Western culture.
                    In his thought, authentic art arises precisely from the tension and interaction between these
                    principles, from the ability to hold together form and impulse, measure and intoxication, without
                    one negating the other. Far from being separable, the Apollonian and the Dionysian intertwine,
                    contaminate one another, and undergo constant transformation.<br>
                    It is therefore unsurprising that countless works of art, originating from different periods,
                    places, and artistic languages, engage with these themes, sometimes emphasizing one pole, sometimes
                    blending them in complex and ambiguous ways. Painting, sculpture, music, literature, and the
                    performing arts have continuously reworked this fundamental tension, making it visible in both the
                    forms and the contents of artistic creation.<br>
                    The <i>Tyrsos & Lyre Mouseion</i> was conceived precisely from these reflections. The exhibition
                    presents works drawn from heterogeneous cultural contexts and different historical periods, united
                    by the explicit or underlying presence of one or both of these principles. The aim is not to rigidly
                    classify the works, but to offer visitors an interpretive framework that highlights how the
                    Apollonian and the Dionysian continue to operate as structuring forces within the human imagination.

                <h4 class="doc-title" id="2"><b>2. The Collection</b></h4>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The current collection, which can also be visited physically until 30 February 2027 at the evocative
                    Temple of Apollo, within the Sanctuary of Delphi at the foot of Mount Parnassus, brings together a
                    heterogeneous group of works spanning an exceptionally broad chronological range. The exhibited
                    artifacts extend from the Greco-Roman period to the contemporary era, offering visitors a journey
                    across different epochs, artistic languages, and cultural contexts, all united by the presence of
                    Apollonian and Dionysian principles.<br>
                    The selection includes objects of varied nature and function. Alongside everyday items, such as cups
                    used for the symposium, a ritual moment closely associated with the Dionysian sphere, there are
                    theatrical masks, which refer to the world of stage performance and the dual dimension of tragedy
                    and comedy.<br>
                    The collection also includes statues and paintings depicting Apollo and Dionysus, as well as written
                    texts, theoretical treatises, and musical scores that, since antiquity, have contributed to
                    articulating, questioning, and at times problematizing this fundamental dichotomy.<br>
                    Architecture and the representation of society are likewise present within the exhibition path. Some
                    paintings depict the city through radically opposing visions: on the one hand, the orderly,
                    rational, and ideal city; on the other, the dynamic, chaotic, and pulsating city.<br>
                    As can also be observed through the Map available in <a
                        href="/Apollonian-Dionysian/the_museum.html">The Museum</a>
                    section, the objects have been arranged according to a precise spatial criterion within the temple’s
                    chambers. On the right side of the exhibition route are concentrated the artifacts primarily
                    associated with the Apollonian principle, while those related to the Dionysian principle are placed
                    on the left side.<br>
                    The works are presented in pairs of opposites, selected to allow visitors a direct comparison
                    between objects linked by a shared thematic thread but oriented toward different poles of the
                    dichotomy.<br>
                    Below are presented the 18 works on display, in the order in which visitors will encounter them
                    along the exhibition route, structured according to the Dionysian–Apollonian axis that shapes the
                    entire exhibition experience.

                <!-- 3 -->
                <h4 class="doc-title" id="3"><b>3. The Logo</b></h4>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The Association’s logo, visible on the left side of the website’s navigation bar, constitutes a
                    visual synthesis of the conceptual principles underlying the exhibition and the identity of the
                    <i>Tyrsos & Lyre Mouseion</i>.<br>
                    The name <i>Tyrsos & Lyre</i> explicitly refers to these two symbolic objects. The thyrsus, a ritual
                    staff wrapped in ivy and topped with a pinecone, is one of the most recognizable emblems of
                    Dionysus. The lyre, a musical instrument traditionally attributed to Apollo, embodies the opposite
                    and complementary principle: harmony, measure, proportion, and the ability to transform chaos into
                    order through sound.<br>
                    From a formal perspective, the logo combines these two elements into a unified and balanced
                    composition. The lyre is depicted through vertical and symmetrical lines, while the thyrsus
                    introduces organic and ascending movement. Above the lyre is placed a stylized sun, a direct
                    reference to Apollo as the god of light and clarity, reinforcing the Apollonian dimension of reason,
                    illumination, and formal balance. The presence of the sun visually anchors the lyre to the principle
                    of luminosity and knowledge, completing the symbolic triad that defines the logo.<br>
                    The use of a restrained color palette and an essential graphic style further reinforces the
                    institutional character of the logo, clearly expressing its cultural mission: to explore the
                    relationship between the Apollonian and the Dionysian as an ongoing dialogue.
                </p>

                <!-- 4 -->
                <h4 class="doc-title" id="4"><b>4. The Aesthetic and Stylistic Choices</b></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2.25rem;">
                    Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetics have a well-established stylistic perception in the collective
                    imagination. For this reason, the design of this website aims to reflect this shared perception,
                    which is also evident in the art historically associated with these two archetypes. The primary
                    visual approach of the site is therefore divided into Dark and Light modes, representing Dionysus
                    and Apollo respectively. Users can switch between these modes via a toggle, implemented using
                    JavaScript that updates the CSS custom properties defined in :root.<br>The CSS design has been
                    carefully crafted to support this dual aesthetic. In Dark Mode (Dionysian), the palette is dominated
                    by deep, muted tones—#2a2422 for backgrounds, warm highlights like #F4C430, and accent colors such
                    as #9c2844 and #641527. This choice conveys intensity, mystery, and expressiveness, evoking the
                    emotional and immersive qualities associated with Dionysus. Light Mode (Apollonian), in contrast,
                    uses soft neutrals and warm shades—#F3E9DA for the background, #eba311 for titles, and #8B3A2F for
                    links—promoting clarity, harmony, and balance, in line with Apollo’s rational and ordered aesthetic.

                    Typography reinforces this duality: the serif font Cardo is used as the main text font, providing
                    readability and classical elegance, while Cinzel is reserved for headings to communicate gravitas
                    and formality. Font sizes are thoughtfully scaled across devices, ensuring hierarchy, legibility,
                    and a consistent reading rhythm. For example, base font size is 1.2em with responsive adjustments
                    for smaller screens, and headings are proportionally sized to emphasize content importance.

                    Other stylistic details, such as button shapes, modal overlays, and hover effects, have been
                    designed to complement the color palettes and enhance interactivity. The theme switch itself uses
                    visual metaphors—☽ for night (Dionysian) and ☼ for day (Apollonian)—while smooth transitions,
                    gradients, and shadows create a cohesive, polished user experience.<br>Below is an overview of the
                    main stylistic choices made for the website, detailing colors,
                    typography, and design rationale for both Apollonian (Light) and Dionysian (Dark) aesthetics.</p>

                <h4 class="doc-title" id="5"><b>5. The Home Page</b></h4>
                <p>
                    The homepage of <strong>Tyrsos &amp; Lyre</strong> is built around <strong>simplicity and visual
                        impact</strong>,
                    drawing inspiration from major museum websites like the <strong>British Museum</strong>. At the top,
                    the
                    <strong>hero section</strong> features Caravaggio’s <em>Bacchus</em>, positioned on the left
                    according to the
                    <strong>golden ratio</strong>. This placement leaves the center for the title
                    <strong>“Tyrsos &amp; Lyre”</strong> and an empty space to the right, creating balance and breathing
                    room.
                    The user is thus invited to take a glass of wine, immediately setting the
                    <strong>immersive atmosphere of the symposium</strong>, and is then welcomed to the exhibition with
                    a
                    <strong>Nietzsche quotation</strong> on the Apollonian and Dionysian.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below the hero, a <strong>brief introduction</strong> guides the visitor. Conceived as the
                    <strong>only purely textual part</strong>, it provides just the essential information, keeping the
                    focus on
                    <strong>images</strong> and a few carefully chosen elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The homepage then presents <strong>two main sections</strong> as horizontal cards:
                    <strong>“The Narratives”</strong> and <strong>“The Museum.”</strong> Each pairs an image with a
                    link,
                    making navigation intuitive while letting visuals speak for themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>collection section</strong> allows users to explore freely through a horizontal
                    scroller,
                    dynamically populated with <strong>JavaScript</strong> using a <strong>JSON file</strong>. Clicking
                    on any
                    object opens a <strong>modal with metadata</strong>, enabling deeper exploration without leaving the
                    page.
                    A <strong>ticket booking section</strong> follows, featuring a simple form and a confirmation modal
                    to
                    complete the experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Navigation is always available via a <strong>fixed-top navbar</strong>, which includes options to
                    switch
                    <strong>visual themes</strong> and toggle between <strong>dark and light modes</strong>. The
                    <strong>footer</strong>, large and comprehensive, is organized into three columns with practical
                    information, links to all main sections, and details about the project and institution, with a
                    <strong>rights note</strong> placed at the very bottom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, the homepage balances <strong>minimal text</strong>, <strong>large visual
                        sections</strong>, and
                    <strong>interactive elements</strong>, guiding the visitor through the exhibition in a clear,
                    immersive,
                    and visually engaging way, while leaving space to explore freely at their own pace.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 2.25rem;">
                    The Exhibition page constitutes the core of the virtual museum experience, presenting the complete set of works included in the Tyrsos & Lyre Mouseion. Conceived as a digital gallery, the page allows visitors to explore the collection as a unified corpus, without predefined interpretive paths, thus offering a direct encounter with the artworks.<br>
                    The layout is structured as a grid of eighteen items, each represented by an image and a concise descriptive text. By selecting an artwork, visitors can access additional information through an interactive modal window, which provides extended descriptions and metadata. This design choice emphasizes visual engagement while maintaining clarity and accessibility, encouraging free navigation across different periods, media, and thematic orientations.<br>
                    The Exhibition page reflects the conceptual axis of the Apollonian and the Dionysian not through explicit categorization, but through juxtaposition. By placing works associated with order, harmony, and measure alongside those expressing excess, transformation, and emotional intensity, the page invites users to reflect on the coexistence and tension between these principles within the history of art.
                </p>


                    <!-- 8 -->
                <h4 class="doc-title" id="8"><b>8. The Narratives Page</b></h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2.25rem;">
                    The Narratives page offers an alternative mode of exploration based on interpretive frameworks rather than on the complete display of the collection. Its purpose is to guide visitors through the artworks by proposing thematic and conceptual paths that foreground specific aspects of the Apollonian–Dionysian dichotomy.<br>
                    Two main narrative approaches are presented: one based on symbolic figures, focusing on Apollo and Dionysus as archetypal forces, and another organized around artistic domains, such as performing arts, visual arts, and literature. These narratives allow users to approach the same collection from different perspectives, highlighting how recurring ideas and tensions manifest across diverse artistic languages.<br>
                    By structuring the experience through narratives, the page emphasizes interpretation, comparison, and critical reflection. Rather than offering a linear or hierarchical reading of the works, it encourages visitors to construct their own understanding of the exhibition, reinforcing the idea that meaning emerges through the dynamic interaction between order and excess, structure and transformation.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The Themes section allows visitors to explore the exhibition through stylistic and cultural frameworks rather than
                    through chronology or individual artworks. Each theme corresponds to a specific aesthetic environment that
                    reinterprets the Apollonian–Dionysian dichotomy by translating it into visual language, atmosphere, and interaction
                    design.

                <p>
                    Inspired by the Belle Époque, this theme conveys mystery, elegance, and poetic decadence. The
                    background blends deep bottle green (<span style="color:#132018;">#132018</span>) into near-black
                    (<span style="color:#0b0c0b;">#0b0c0b</span>), while text is warm ivory (<span
                        style="color:#e8dfc9;">#e8dfc9</span>) for readability. Headings and titles use muted olive
                    green (<span style="color:#3a4f2c;">#3a4f2c</span>) and golden highlights (<span
                        style="color:#d1b24a;">#d1b24a</span>), while rich reds (<span

                    emphasized text) punctuate the layout. Borders and modals incorporate subtle glows (<span
                        style="color:#F4D06F;">#F4D06F</span>) and semi-transparent dark backgrounds
                    (rgba(15,13,12,0.96)) for coherence.
                    <br><br>
                    The hero section features a Chat Noir–inspired image under a gradient overlay, with expressive
                    typography and a circular “absinthe bottle” button referencing the decadent motifs of the era. The
                    composition balances color, texture, and interactive elements to
                    immerse visitors in a world of elegance, mystery, and Belle Époque drama.
                </p>


                <!-- 9.4 -->
                <h5 class="doc-subtitle" id="9-1"><b>9.4 Art Deco</b></h5>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The Art Deco theme emphasizes order, symmetry, and formal elegance, aligning predominantly with the Apollonian
                    principle. Inspired by the visual culture of the early twentieth century and literary imaginaries such as
                    <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, this theme conveys a sense of controlled luxury, geometric clarity, and aesthetic
                    refinement. The structured layouts, restrained color palette, and decorative motifs evoke a world in which excess
                    is disciplined by form, and pleasure is framed within precise architectural and visual boundaries.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    At the same time, the presence of Dionysian elements is not entirely suppressed. Beneath the polished surface,
                    the theme hints at underlying desires, ambition, and social performance. The Art Deco aesthetic thus becomes a
                    visual expression of the tension between measured harmony and latent excess, reflecting the fragile balance
                    between Apollonian control and Dionysian impulse.
                </p>

                <!-- 9.5 -->
                <h5 class="doc-subtitle" id="9-2"><b>9.2 Psychedelic 70s</b></h5>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The Psychedelic 70s theme foregrounds the Dionysian dimension of the exhibition through vibrant colors, fluid forms,
                    and immersive visual effects. Drawing inspiration from the culture of nightclubs, discotheques, and collective
                    dance experiences, this theme emphasizes sensory overload, rhythm, and altered perception. The intense chromatic
                    palette and dynamic graphic elements create an atmosphere of movement and emotional intensity.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    In this context, the Dionysian principle manifests as loss of individual boundaries and immersion in a collective
                    experience driven by music and bodily presence. Apollonian structure is deliberately weakened, appearing only in
                    residual forms that prevent complete visual chaos. The resulting aesthetic mirrors the tension between freedom
                    and form, echoing the ecstatic yet transient nature of the disco culture of the 1970s.
                </p>

                <h5 class="doc-subtitle" id="9-6"><b>9.6 90s Games</b></h5>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    This theme merges the bold, chaotic energy of 90s video games with a sense of nostalgic futurism.
                    The color palette is central to this aesthetic. The deep indigo background (<span
                        style="color:#0A0A50;">#0A0A50</span>), overlaid with subtle gradients, creates mystery and
                    depth reminiscent of late-night arcade screens or neon-lit streets. Neon accents dominate the visual
                    language: cyan (<span style="color:#00FFEA;">#00FFEA</span>) for main text ensures legibility,
                    luminous green (<span style="color:#39FF14;">#39FF14</span>) for titles pops immediately, yellow
                    (<span style="color:#FFFF00;">#FFFF00</span>) highlights guide the eye, and bold magentas (<span
                        style="color:#FF00FF;">#FF00FF</span> and <span style="color:#FF1493;">#FF1493</span>) bring
                    intensity to links, borders, and interactive elements.
                    <br><br>
                    The hero section features Bacchus, “Bac-man,” generated with ChatGPT, layered under a gradient that
                    fades to black to enhance depth. The scrolling crawl animation, adapted and modified from <a
                        href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/star-wars-crawl-text/">CSS-Tricks</a>, creates a
                    retro, theatrical introduction.
                    <br><br>
                    Navigation bars, buttons, and modals follow the same neon, high-contrast logic. Deep blues and
                    purples form the background canvas, while glowing borders, overlays, and hover effects reinforce the
                    arcade and retro-futuristic vibe. The combination of colors and the layered hero image creates
                    movement and energy, evoking the excitement of booting up a game or watching a 90s cinematic
                    opening.

                    <b>The default styling</b> is handled globally through a single <b>main.css</b> file, supported by a
                    shared external JavaScript file (<b>common.js</b>) used for common functionalities across pages.
                    <b>The Museum section and the Homepage</b> rely on additional external JavaScript files for their
                    specific behaviors, whereas <b>the narrative-related pages</b> do not use page-specific external
                    scripts.<br><br>

                    <b>Object descriptions and metadata</b> displayed in the <b>Exhibition section of the Homepage</b>
                    are dynamically populated inside modals via an external JavaScript file (<b>scripts/home.js</b>) in

                    <b>In general, external files</b> are used whenever reusability, maintainability, or dynamic
