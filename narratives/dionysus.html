                <p class="desc-short mb-3 small">
                In The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne, taken from Lorenzo de’ Medici’s Carnival Songs, the poet brings to life the mythical procession of Bacchus and Ariadne: Ariadne, abandoned on the island of Naxos, is found and taken as bride by the god of wine. The myth becomes a celebration of youth, pleasure, and festivity, but also an invitation to seize the moment, aware of life’s fleeting nature.
                </p>

                <!-- LONG -->
                <p class="desc-long mb-3 d-none">
                The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne, written by Lorenzo de’ Medici probably for the Carnival of 1490, belongs to his Carnival Songs (Canti Carnascialeschi), poems meant to be sung collectively during Florentine festivities.
                <br>
                In the text, the myth of Ariadne, the Cretan princess abandoned by the hero Theseus on the island of Naxos, is revisited and transformed: Ariadne is rescued and exalted by the god Bacchus, who parades triumphantly with his procession of satyrs, nymphs, and maenads. The tone is festive and playful, yet beneath it lies a deeper reflection: “How beautiful is youth, / which yet so quickly flies away!” («Quant’è bella giovinezza, / che si fugge tuttavia!») the refrain that becomes a moral lesson to live the present fully.
                <br>
                The use of myth here goes far beyond simple storytelling: Bacchus and Ariadne are not merely mythological figures, but symbols of beauty, love, sensuality, and vitality, all to be savored before time consumes them. The triumph of Bacchus is thus the triumph of pleasure, youth, and life itself, but also a reminder of their fragility and impermanence.
                <br>
                In the humanist culture of Lorenzo’s Florence, the myth takes on an allegorical meaning. The carnival becomes not just a time of revelry, but a reflection on transience and the human condition: Bacchus embodies the joy of living and the power of desire, while Ariadne, once abandoned and then redeemed, represents renewal through love. Together they express a Renaissance carpe diem: an invitation to embrace life joyfully, with both awareness and passion, before it fades away.

                <p class="desc-short mb-3 small">
                This papyrus fragment from Oxyrhynchus preserves a portion of Plato’s Symposium, a dialogue set in the context of a banquet and centered on eros as a disruptive and transformative force. The manuscript reflects the Dionysian dimensions of desire, intoxication, and emotional excess embedded in the text.

                This papyrus fragment, discovered at Oxyrhynchus and now preserved in the Cairo Museum, transmits part of Plato’s Symposium. Produced in the Roman period, the manuscript provides material evidence for the circulation of Platonic dialogues in antiquity and their reception within performative and convivial contexts.<br>
                The Symposium is structured around a drinking party in which participants engage in speeches on eros, a force that destabilizes rational control and opens the subject to transformation. In this fragmentary witness, love emerges primarily through its Dionysian aspects: desire, intoxication, emotional intensity, and the temporary suspension of social and intellectual order.<br>
                Although the dialogue ultimately moves toward philosophical articulation, the preserved text foregrounds the experiential dimension of eros, aligning the Symposium with the Dionysian principle of excess and collective experience. As a material object, the papyrus echoes this instability: its fragmentary state and organic medium underscore the tension between ephemeral experience and textual permanence.

                The black-figure drinking kylix (cup), created by the potter and vase painter Exekias around 530 BC, is one of the most famous ancient vessels of all time.<br>
                Inside you can see Dionysus, the god of wine, lying on a ship with a swelled white sail. Along the mast, vines climb up and dolphins dance around the ship. With this picture, the beholder is to be reminded of a well-known myth about the god: Dionysus had been captured by Etruscan pirates and abducted aboard their ship. On the high seas, however, the god appeared to the men in his true form, after which they were seized with panic and they plunged into the sea where Dionysus transformed them into dolphins.<br>
                Whoever drank from this bowl had a rather peculiar experience: for him, the god emerged from the sea of red wine, he floated on the waves for a brief moment and then he sailed his ship into the drinker’s open mouth. The bowl was therefore much more than just an extravagant drinking vessel. Through each sip, the user came closer to the god Dionysus, as it were.<br>
                Furthermore, on the exterior there are the characteristic features that gave this type of cup its name: the eye-cup. Two large painted eyes decorate the surface; when drinking from the cup, they align with the drinker's own, creating the illusion that the person has taken on new, typically Dionysian traits.<br>
                Exekias was well aware of the outstanding quality of the vessel he had created.<br>
                He signed his work on the outside on the edge of the foot of the vessel:"Exekias epoiese” - Exekias made it.
